taili1o1,After being a prime minister for 10 years Modi and achieve nothing in safety
saher_scoop,The details of the case make one disgusted to the core. No woman deserves to face such brutality. Doctors and civil society should unite in protest to hold the culprits and the government officials protecting them accountable.
rits.manohar,How about a law where men can't roam at night past a certain hour? Like how Bangalore has a curfew for nightclubs?

kate__n23,The details of this case made me tear up. India is SO unsafe for women because of the extremely patriarchal & sexist society.

mangalamary24,It is sad that people have to demand for days to obtain justice. When other countries have quick action on women related crimes.
aaratrikaaaa,the fact that this was done by her fellow residents and coworkers is what should be brought to the limelight. they are roaming free now due to their political connection and power/money 🙄 ridiculous administration.

If cases like these happen in the west it's just treated as any another day one more crime something in the newspaper , but not in india people take it seriously and protest about it it's not a normal day in india . That's why it gets more attention in media. Also its just not india which is unsafe for women I think the whole world is , and we should change it making it safe for women"

kanwar.divya,@bbcnews why can't India have laws or rules like Arab nations in cases like these..being a woman of 35 I'm sure there's hardly a single woman who hasn't ever been harrassed in one way or another..It won't stop till the time there are HARSH punishments or laws against molestors/harassers/rapists..neither a girl child 3.5 years is safe these days in India nor an old lady of 85...how are we even celebrating Independence Day or Republic Day..

marsblackstudio,@therealslimwhitey they are not saying harassment doesn't happen in other places. Harassment is absolutely under reported everywhere....look at the me too movement...but it is not commonplace to fell unsafe in public all the time as a woman like it is in India. That is a completely different level of patriarchy.

Stop giving people antinational tags just because they say , they are unsafe in India. Stop saying us to move to other countries. This is my homeland , i deserve to be safe here , i expect to be safe here and it is the govt's and men/women of India's duty to keep the citizen safe.

system_hai_bhaiya,ये भारत है मेरी बहना यह लोग भेड़ बकरियों की तरह चलते हैं और हमेशा से नारी की सक्ति को पहचान नहीं होने देना चाहते है ताकि इस चीज का बार बार वो आनंद उठा सके क्योंकि यहां का कानून अंधा और बहरा है और सरकार की तो बात ही छोड़ो क्यू कि करने वाला सरकार का आदमी निकल जाता है इसी वजह से सरकार भी चुप हो जाता है इस भ्रम में मत जियो आप लोग की ये कैंडल जलाने वाले लोग आप की सहायता करेंगे आज कैंडल जलाएंगे कल दिन फिर इन्हीं में से आप का रेप करेंगें इन सब से उपर उठ के सोचने की जरूरत है आज कल के लड़कियों के अंदर की झांसी मार गई है जिसे जागने की जरूरत है और खुद को इतना तो काबिल बनाओ की किसी साले की नजर आप के तरफ ना उठे खुद को मजबूत करने की जरूरत है देवी लोग

reyyan_rishitha,"""Justice"" is something that you will never get in India"
dk.deepakpu,"This is not something everyone wash off their hands on by blaming Modi, Mamta or any politician. We are responsible for this because we are that policeman that takes bribes and close the files without proper investigation, we are the legal professionals who do not bring justice to the victim, and we are part of the community that doesn't mould children to be better human being, we are drunk, we are polluted, and we are corrupt. There is no gender disparity in corruption and inefficiency. There is no gender in favouritism and lack of sincererity."
aliramatilda,Give them justice 🙏
anupam.1644,now show us the chief minister of that state protesting against a really peculiar hallucination that she calls justice

mohandas.vinod,"Hi BBC, Why you guys are not showing as a breaking news of rape and murder happening in your country? I know in your country there are lots of attacks happening against women such as rape & murder. You guys only shows attacks happening against women in India as bug news. There should be no partiality in this issue. Is it because you can attack women in your own country, and nobody should question it?"
atulnath_01,"When we have a woman chief minister @mamataofficial who believes rapes are happening because men and women freely interact, I really feel women and society in general really got no hope. A large responsibility of rapes have to be attributed to our Societal Structure and Our Media, especially Movies all of which have created an impression that women is something that man  can ""achieve"" and ""controlled over"". Be it a misfortune day for a hapless woman in a regular city or be it a war torn nation or certain Patricial societies, the damage and worst sufferers and victims are always women. This stems from all the systems we have created. It is time that we create societies where young boys are able to understand girls and womanhood..learn to respect biology and needs rather than portraying women as weakling or as Taboo mysterious object that they have to achieve over #india #women #girlpower #bengal #karcollege #modi #rahulgandhi"

samriddharoy,"Kindly broadcast plight of Bengali women. We are in comstant threats, in utter insecurity and unrest around. 
Here election is a farce, we have little right to vote, to do job and articulate our voice. 
So we walked down in protest, it's going on with reference to the recent heinous most rape of a Doctor on duty.
She was vocal about the worlds most dangerous racket.
Here ruling party (CM herself) shelters and even patrons corrupts, thugs, rapists. 
we want CM to step down and immediate president rule. Save us."

chroudwat19,What a shame India isn’t safe place for women.
anamaria_life_coach,"@bbcnews please I'm begging you to cover the whole story that's happening - the woman was gang raped and brutally murdered afterwards, the hospital management tried to cover it as suicide and hasn't even filled a report until other dcotors started protesting. These doctors were then attacked by a mob with another doctor who was attending attacked, raped and murdered. The case is very dirty with high level politicians involved and corruption - women in India don't feel safe because men in power can get away with heinous acts because of corruption. Please give these women a voice, publicise the whole story so they are exposed in the West. Beautiful women of India deserve justice and safety 🙏🏻😢"
